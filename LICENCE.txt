Macleod: a common logic environment for ontology development.
This program consists of a set of scripts designed for specific
reasoning tasks frequently encountered in ontology design and 
verification. While the program primiarily targets first-order 
ontologies specified in the Common Logic syntax, some parts of it can
also be used for reasoning about ontologies in LADR (Prover9/Mace4)
or TPTP syntax (accepted by many first-order theorem provers and 
model finders).
